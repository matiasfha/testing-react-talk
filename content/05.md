# üëë The tests hierarchy. Or where to put your effort.

1Ô∏è‚É£ *End to End*: A helper that behaves like your user clicking around the app checking that everything function as expected.

Typically it will run the entire app (FE and BE). Cypress and Playwright are the most used tools here

üí∞ These are the costly ones.
üê¢ These are also the slower ones.
ü§ô More Confidence 

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.


```javascript
describe('App', () => {
  it('should work for a typical user', () => {
    cy.visit('/')

    cy.findByText(/register/i).click()

    cy.findByLabelText(/username/i).type("usernam")

    cy.findByLabelText(/password/i).type("password")

    cy.findByText(/login/i).click()
    // etc...
    
  })
})
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ *Integration*: Verify that the pieces of your app work together in harmony.

Often renders the full app or a piece of it with all the providers used by the app (Router, Context, Theming, etc).
Mock as little as possible, like:
  - Network requests
  - Animations

Example: Testing "Views" or "Pages" of your app.

```js
import * as React from 'react'
import {render, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import {build, fake} from '@jackfranklin/test-data-bot'
import {rest} from 'msw'
import {setupServer} from 'msw/node'
import {handlers} from 'test/server-handlers'
import App from '../app'

const buildLoginForm = build({
  fields: {
    username: fake(f => f.internet.userName()),
    password: fake(f => f.internet.password()),
  },
})

// Mock HTTP Server with MSW
const server = setupServer(...handlers)

// Cleanup the server
beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterAll(() => server.close())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())

test(`logging in displays the user's username`, async () => {
  await render(<App />, {route: '/login'})
  const {username, password} = buildLoginForm()

  userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/username/i), username)
  userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText(/password/i), password)
  userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', {name: /submit/i}))

  expect(screen.getByText(username)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ *Unit*: Test pieces in isolation.

Very similar to the previous one but without the mocking part. *Is not integrated*: Individual Components.

4Ô∏è‚É£ *Static*: Linting and typechecking.
